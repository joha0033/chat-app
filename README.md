# chat-app
Basic swift project with Firebase Database, Auth, Storage

## Setup
Clone from Xcode and create a unique bundle identifier

## Basics 
#### (my first swift app!)
Users can login or create an account and then credentials are stored and authenticated by Firebase. 
Once a user creates an account or logs in, user will be taken to a profile screen. 
Here you can go to settings and select a profile picture from your phone's PhotosLibrary.
In the profile is a list of users to select from to begin or revisit a chat.
Once a chat is started, messages are sent and recieved in real time.
